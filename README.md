4. **Regular Practice**: Consistency improves reading speed over time
5. **Minimize Subvocalization**: Avoid "hearing" words in your head
6. **Use Resume Feature**: Take breaks and resume exactly where you left off

## Troubleshooting

### RSVP Won't Start
- Ensure the document has extractable text
- Try manually starting RSVP from the menu first
- Check that tap-to-launch is enabled in settings

### Text Extraction Issues
- Some PDF files may have non-extractable text
- Try converting to EPUB format for better compatibility
- Ensure the document is not password-protected

### Performance Issues
- Reduce preview word count if the interface feels slow
- Lower the reading speed if words appear too quickly
- Restart KOReader if the plugin becomes unresponsive
